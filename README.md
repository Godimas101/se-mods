### Scripts
Additional utility scripts and standalone tools for Space Engineers modding.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Space Engineers game installation
- Space Engineers Mod SDK (auto-installs via Steam)
- Visual Studio or VS Code for C# development
- .NET Framework (included with SDK)

### SDK Location
The Space Engineers Mod SDK is located here once installed from Steam:
```
SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineersModSDK\
```

After Steam installs/updates Space Engineers, the SDK is automatically updated. Use it for:
- API reference (DLLs with XML documentation)
- Decompiling source implementations
- Asset structure examples (models, textures)
- Testing tools (ModelViewer, etc.)

### Building Mods
1. Reference SDK DLLs in your C# project for IntelliSense
2. Write mod scripts in `Data/Scripts/<namespace>/`
3. Register text surface scripts in `Data/TextSurfaceScripts.sbc` (if applicable)
4. Test in game by placing mod in `%AppData%\SpaceEngineers\Mods\` or via workshop

## AI Assistant Skill

This repository includes a comprehensive **Space Engineers Modding Skill** for AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.).

### What It Provides

2. Open the `space-engineers-mods` folder in VS Code
3. The skill will be automatically detected from `.github/skills/`
4. Start chatting - the skill is available immediately

**For Claude Desktop / Claude.ai:**

**Option 1: Project-Scoped (this repository only)**
1. Clone this repository
2. Add this folder to your Claude project workspace
3. The skill will be available when working in this project
4. Type `/space-engineers-modding` or mention modding topics

**Option 2: Global (available in all Claude sessions)**
1. Copy the skill folder to Claude's global skills directory:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\<YourName>\.claude\skills\space-engineers-modding\`

## Important Modding Principles

### Backward Compatibility (Critical for Workshop Releases)
- **Never break existing CustomData formats** - Add new options, don't remove/rename
- **Support old config keys** - Check for both old and new formats
- **Test with existing configs** - Verify old CustomData still works before releasing
- **Graceful degradation** - New features should be optional
- **Document breaking changes** - Clearly note incompatibilities in mod descriptions

### Performance
- Cache subgrid scans and update infrequently
- Minimize LINQ in performance-critical code
- Always check for dedicated servers: `if (MyAPIGateway.Utilities?.IsDedicated ?? false) return;`
- Use composite keys for dictionaries when mixing item TypeIds

### Safety
- Always null-check block/component access
- Wrap DetailedInfo parsing in try/catch
- Never rely on default parameter values
- Validate all user configuration input

## Common Issues

### Item Type Collisions
Items can share SubtypeIds but have different TypeIds (e.g., `ConsumableItem_Fruit` vs `SeedItem_Fruit`).

**Solution:** Use composite keys: `$"{typeId}_{subtypeId}"`

### Multi-Category Scrolling Space Calculation
Each category must calculate space from current drawing position, not screen top.

**Solution:** `float currentY = position.Y - surfaceData.viewPortOffsetY;`

### VRage.MyFixedPoint
Inventory amounts are `MyFixedPoint`, not `int` or `float`.

**Solution:** `int amount = (int)item.Amount;` or `item.Amount.ToIntSafe()`

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and the skill's `known-issues.md` for complete lists.
