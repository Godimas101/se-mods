# 🛸 Space Engineers Mods

> **"LCD scripts, server tweaks, and compatibility patches for engineers who like their bases slightly overengineered."**

This repo is the main home for my Space Engineers mod collection, now split out as the standalone `se-mods` repo. The flagship project is **InfoLCD**, backed up by server-focused balance work, compatibility patches, and a handful of odd little utility mods.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Browse the `Mods/` folder for the mod or project you want
2. Use the Space Engineers Mod SDK to test changes locally or prep Workshop updates
3. If you need asset prep, use the companion tools:
   - [`universal-image-converter`](https://github.com/Godimas101/universal-image-converter/releases/latest)
   - [`universal-audio-converter`](https://github.com/Godimas101/universal-audio-converter/releases/latest)

## ✨ What's in the Hangar

### 📊 InfoLCD Series

| Mod | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **InfoLCD - Apex Update** | Active development | Built for the Apex Update modpack |
| **InfoLCD - Apex Advanced** | Maintenance only | Kept in sync for the Apex Advanced pack |

20+ specialized screens live across the InfoLCD work: items, cargo, power, production, ammo, components, doors, damage, gas, life support, and more. Expect scrolling lists, category filtering, subgrid scanning, and CustomData-driven configuration.

For the actual scripts, SBCs, and mod assets, start in [`Mods/InfoLCD - Apex Update/`](Mods/InfoLCD%20-%20Apex%20Update/).
